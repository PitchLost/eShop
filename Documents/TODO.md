Login needs to be made. No clue about GET yet. 



# cart: 


The cart Styles are better now but still need work. Currently they will jsut keep stacking and changing the position of the top one. 

On top of that I had to delete the mainStock section... This section was always broken and needed work for a long time. It broke the cart everytime one of the 
items was added from mainStock and was really fucking up the site

# mainStock plan

The main thing to remember this time when doing the mainStock is to ensure that the items are displayed as ROW instead of COLUMM like they were prev.
Worst case scenario split the section into half and do it like the rest of the sections are displayed.
